  <h2><a id="session1">Session 1 - New Recruits Part 1</a></h2>
  <p>The new recruits arrived in the town of Mossbourne for their test mission and were quickly met by Ragna Frostbeard, paladin of Istus, who provided them with a mission briefing and a pack of standard issue equipment. From there, they went on their way. After talking to Melody, the tiefling who owns The Smoking Hare Inn, they learned that Valleth, a local hunter, was attacked by extremely aggressive deer.</p>
  <p>Valleth turned out to be a wood elf on the younger side of adult and she was seriously injured in the attack. She was able to provide the party with information about where the deer attack occurred. She also mentioned that Elovar Kyrick, the husband of the owner of the Kyrick and Sons General Store was also missing. Deciding they needed to talk to Valwynn Kyrick, a firbolg, they learned that her husband had indeed gone off to find out why supplies had stopped coming in. Their teenage child didn't seem to know anything about what might have happened.</p>
  <p>Heading into the woods, the party quickly found the hostile deer and put them down. Proceeding further north, though, they began to find tracks that showed that people had been in the area along with a bear. These tracks lead to a cave where they found bandits. New World lured one bandit out with a bear roar and that bandit had a crisis of faith, threw down his things, and ran home to become a baker. From there, they went inside to track down the other bandits. They put them down and also discovered a ritual circle and magic staff of some kind. New World broke the staff and Valakas killed the bear. Eurie kept one of the bandits alive to question and Kai put someone else to sleep with her magic.</p>

    <h2><a id="session2">Session 2 - New Recruits Part 2 - Out of the Frying Pan Part 1</a></h2>
    <p>Delving deeper into the cave the party found Elovar trapped in a cell. After rescuing him and attempting to bind the sleeping bandit, they discovered that the bandits had been living here. They found a total of 14g and a magical horn that hasn't been identified. They also found the goods that Elovar was trying to bring home and helped return those to the town.</p>
    <p>They met back up with Ragna who welcomed them into the guild and gave each of them a badge to show that they were members. With that, it was time to head to the guild headquarters and the group got their first look at their new home, and the pit nearby known as The Birth of Conflagration. They met Melantha Steele while selecting their beds and she welcomed them on board, and ended up also giving them a second mission if they were willing to take it.</p>
    <p>After being asked to handle an elemental situation that was exacerbating a forest fire, they went first to meet the Quartermaster, a goblin named Zedri who has a unique sense of organization. They retrieved their mission briefing and supply pack before going to talk to the ~Archmage~~ Librarian Jeremiah Nolan. He gave them some information about the elemental that he'd managed to glean, along with asking them to retrieve him a jar of dirt from his hometown of Oxhollow, since it was near there.</p>
    <p>They made their way to Innismore and discovered that Elias Meadowsong, their intended contact, was missing and his second-in-command, Rosamund Brandwood hadn't seen him since that morning in the fire. They got a direction to search and went out after him. Verne and Eurie working together managed to create a trail for the party to use to move through the inferno, though Eurie's sleeve briefly caught fire.</p>
    <p>Eventually though they found not only the magma lion, but also a tiny hut containing the bard they were seeking. After the group collectively dealt quite a bit of damage, Valakas managed the killing blow. And then they rescued an injured and traumatized Elias.</p>

    <h2><a id="session3">Session 3 - Out of the Frying Pan Part 2</a></h2>
    <p>After helping Elias back to town, getting briefly lost in the heart of a wildfire, and getting a chance to rest, the group did some shopping and then made their way to Oxhollow to retrieve the jar of dirt for Librarian Jeremiah. After retrieving the dirt, they discovered that the Royal Essakov Circus was in town and decided to check out the show.</p>
    <p>There were games to be had, and a devil to make deals with, and pets to buy. Though after some exploring, New World discovered another Kenku by the name of Shush in a cage under the table. They released Shush and offered to help them get home. This led most of the party to wanting to leave but while they weren't looking, Valakas was enthralled by the Ringmaster. </p>
    <p>Most of the show was normal enough, with the usual performances. Then the Ringmaster came out and asked for a volunteer. When he did, Valakas volunteered and ascended the ladder. Halfway out, he slipped and fell to the floor far below. This was enough to break the spell on him and he spoke up about it. After that, the group decided they were done and leaving. At least until another member of the audience, this one a human farmer, stood and moved to take Valakas' place with tears on his cheeks.</p>

    <h2><a id="session4">Session 4 - Out of the Frying Pan Part 3</a></h2>
    <p>Combat broke out under the big top, leading Rodya Essakov to call for his wife, Anja. She appeared with a zombie under her thrall and the party battled them in the ring and out while the audience watched, entranced. Once he was seriously injured, Rodya attempted to flee but he surrendered in order to save his wife. He agreed to pay them for their part in the show only to discover that the show's savings had been stolen during the chaos. With nothing left to offer them, he offered a ride back to the guild hall. The party agreed under the conditions that they would be reporting this once they got there.</p>
    <p>Naturally, this meant that the night before they arrived at the guild hall, the Royal Essakov Circus vanished into the night. They left the party with just the wagon they'd been traveling in and their belongings. But they could make it back to the hall easily enough from there. They gave the jar of dirt to an appreciative Jeremiah and went about settling in for some well earned rest. It was then that Kai spotted the last thing she expected to see here: someone in Lyrskan armor. She tailed the half-orc woman and found her room, learning that her name is Berenike Modesta Raziya. But she was not spotted and did nothing else with this information. Yet.</p>

<h2><a id="session5">Session 5 - Rest and Relaxation</a></h2>
    <p>With several weeks of downtime ahead of them, the party settled in to explore their new home and to work on some personal projects.</p>
    <p>Tova spent some time working on training V. The pup proved to be excitable and energetic, and of course easily distractible. But with some careful training and rewarding, she was capable of teaching her to at least come when called which is certainly progress and extremely useful with a teleporting puppy.</p>
    <p>Verne went to the library to attempt some research and was given access to Jeremiah's personal research and collected reports of unusual or interesting occurrences around the world. Though she did confuse the librarian with precisely what she was looking for, she did manage fairly well searching on her own and got an interesting report to read through.</p>
    <p>The devil Markedar returned to speak with Eurie again, this time with his direct superior, an inky blue devil woman with 3 sets of horns. This time, he had the information Eurie was looking for and offered a deal in exchange for it: the soul of any other member of her temple. When Eurie refused point blank, he offered that he would continue to be available if she changed her mind. The devil woman who didn't introduce herself let Markedar handle the negotiations, not even interceding when he was failing, and simply seemed amused by the whole situation.</p>
    <p>New World took a ship north into the sea to help [Shush] get home and after a few days travel arrived at the Kenku city of Cacophany. There they learned that the vast majority of Kenku spend their time engineering in the hopes of attempting to achieve flight without the use of wings. It was also there that they encountered [Jackal Laughter], a Kenku with a very bluejay appearance, who attempted to bully [Shush] even though they had been gone for a while. New World stepped in, intimidating the bully and running them off. After that, they met [Shush]'s parent, [Fire Crackle], and stayed for a dinner of fish. After returning home, New World decided to go prank Quartermaster Zedri who has since banned them from her office.</p>
    <p>Kai took some time to do research into Lyrsk, learning more about their military and their culture. She also learned from Jeremiah that the Founders have been there and that Lyrsk actively drives dragons out of their borders. After that, she began to put her plan of getting information out of Raziya into practice. She met the half orc in the training yards and asked for help using the space. After some confusion, Raziya was willing to help and showed her around. They sparred for a while with Raziya winning easily. Over the three weeks, they met multiple times with Raziya's walls coming down and more and more as they talked, until the point that she was willing to talk some about home and explained that she's here to train since she's meant to be part of a special forces unit in the Lyrskan Legion and not a normal soldier.</p>
    <p>After exchanging letters with his family, Valakas decided it was time to go thank Lady Luck for that fact that he's somehow still alive. While he was at the temple, he encountered a very drunk dark elven woman who started asking him questions about why he joined the Guild. She turned out to be Imrae Vandree, one of the Founders, and after a bit, her spouse, Charlas Arasalor came looking for her. But not before she invited Valakas to her speakeasy and left a note with directions on how to get there.</p>

    <h2><a id="session6">Session 6 - Is There Anyone Here With Us? Part 1</a></h2>
    <p>The party hired a coach to take them to Foxfield since the journey was quite long. On the way, they encountered reports of bandits along the main roads but elected to leave the problem for now. It could be dealt with later and they had a job they'd been hired for.</p>
    <p>Upon arriving at Foxfield, they met Baronet Tristram and were given a tour of the house as well as full run of the property. They began their investigation from there, starting by hearing footsteps and creaking floorboards. This soon escalated into seeing full bodied apparitions. </p>
    <p>They briefly took a break to reconvene and plan over a dinner Tova made using supplies from the kitchen. Shortly after this, a second spirit arrived and the truth came out. Sir Oswin of the Order of Ravens was not a fallen paladin at all but had been declared so by his Order after he refused to kill the vampire Velaine who now resides in Hesperis and Dame Myra, a fellow knight, came to kill him. After New World jumped in the way and disrupted the cycle, Kai was able to challenge Myra's beliefs about the situation and dispel her ghost entirely. Sir Oswin then faded away. All that was left behind was his holy symbol and her mace.</p>

    <h2><a id="session7">Session 7 - Is There Anyone Here With Us? Part 2</a></h2>
    <p>Having left Foxfield, the party agreed to head to Honeyfall to report in on their success. Arriving at the city gates after several days travel, Valakas was growing more and more uncomfortable which led to his revealing that Honeyfall is his home town and that one of the guards on the gate is his Uncle Narziros, a blue dragonborn. </p>
    <p>They found Baronet Tristram at the home of his cousin, Viscount Amergin, and reported in. He paid each of them 150g for their speedy services in solving his problems. New World gave him the holy symbol they'd found and Verne explained the haunting and causes of it. Which led to Tristram being visibly confused as he was also descended from Dame Myra.</p>
    <p>After this, they went to meet Valakas' mother, a halfing named Jivera Davrick, and also ended up meeting Yezmith, his sister, and Jivera's assorted bard lovers. At first, she presented herself as a simple inn keeper from Celaess but after Valakas explained that he was now purple and had been away so long because of an Archfey and that he trusted his new group, she revealed that she was the Thief Lord of Honeyfall and Windale and also actually from Valente.</p>
    <p>Verne went to the docks to attempt to follow up on a report regarding Sahaugin up the coast and got more information about their growing hostility and their attacks on land-based settlements.</p>
    <p>After that, the party explored the night market, did some shopping and went to the hilltop gardens to explore there as well. There, they encountered Valakas' other sister, Gwindelle, on a date with a dark elven woman named Drisse Maetral, a member of the city watch. After some teasing from Valakas, they left. The party ended up spending the night at Jivera's inn, the Lavender Rose Inn.</p>

    <h2><a id="session8">Session 8 - The Hunt for the Shirrin Kho</a></h2>
    <p>The party moved further up the coast in their search for answers about these Sahaugin attacks and the Shirrin Kho they were searching for. What they found was a small fishing village, small enough not even to have a name, that had been rampaged in the night by a group of Sahaugin. Doors and windows were ripped open and beds and bedding dragged out into the sand. It seemed very much as though they had been searching for someone or something.</p>
    <p>An older Water Genasi woman was searching through the wreckage and the party approached her. Her name was Marilla and she explained that she was looking for her son, Caspian, who was about 17 and missing. The party agreed to go looking for him and they headed further up the coast.</p>
    <p>This was where they first encountered the Sahaugin who came ashore and spoke to them, although only Verne understood since they spoke Primordial. They explained that they were looking for their Chosen One, the Shirrin Kho, and asked Verne to come with them. After she refused to go without the party, the Sahaugin attacked. Kai managed to kill several of them with a single spell which gave the party the leverage needed to insist that they all go or no one goes. They were given potions of Waterbreathing from a ship's survival box and brought under the ocean.</p>
    <p>It was there that they saw the ritual circle and discovered that the Sahaugin were killing the Water Genasi they brought there. Not only that, but they had brought several already. Rather than let them take Verne, the party formed a defense around her and fought the Sahaugin off. In the end, with few spells left between them and several of them badly injured, Tova managed to get a knife in just the right spot to find victory over the Sahaugin Champion. They recovered the bones of the lost Genasi and returned to the surface to find a beach to rest and decide what to do next.</p>
